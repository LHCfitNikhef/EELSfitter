Welcome to EELSfitter website!
=======================================

EELSfiter is an open-source Python-based framework developed for the analysis and interpretation of Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) measurements in Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). EELSfitter is based on the machine learning techniques developed by the NNPDF Collaboration in the context of applications in high energy physics, in particular feed-forward neural networks for unbiased regression in multidimensional problems.
