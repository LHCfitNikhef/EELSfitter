Abstract
--------

This study presents an in-depth investigation of the electronic properties and bandgap energy distribution
in 1D molybdenum disulfide (1D-MoS\ :sub:`2`\ ) nanostructures. Through a combination of high-angle annular
dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS),
it reveals significant differences between 1D-MoS\ :sub:`2`\  nanostructures and their 2D counterparts,
shedding light on their localized exciton behavior and their bandgap energy modulation within the nanostructures.
Excitonic peaks at around 2 and 3 eV appear localized at the ends or along the sides of the 1D-MoS\ :sub:`2`\
nanostructures, while the plasmonic resonance at 8.3 eV retains its inner-region localization. It demonstrates the
spatial dependence of the bandgap energy, with the central region exhibiting a bandgap of approximately 1.2 eV,
consistent with bulk MoS\ :sub:`2`\ , while regions characterized by curvature-induced local strain fields exhibit
instead a noticeable reduction. The findings provide valuable insights into the intricate relationship between
excitonic behavior and bandgap sensitivity in 1D-MoS\ :sub:`2`\  nanostructures, streamlining the design and
optimization of nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices.
