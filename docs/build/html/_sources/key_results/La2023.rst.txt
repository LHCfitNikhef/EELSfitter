Abstract
--------

Among the many potential applications of topological insulator materials, their broad potential for
the development of novel tunable plasmonics at THz and mid-infrared frequencies for quantum computing,
terahertz detectors, and spintronic devices is particularly attractive. The required understanding of
the intricate relationship between nanoscale crystal structure and the properties of the resulting plasmonic
resonances remains, however, elusive for these materials. Specifically, edge- and surface-induced plasmonic
resonances, and other collective excitations, are often buried beneath the continuum of electronic transitions,
making it difficult to isolate and interpret these signals using techniques such as
electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Here we focus on the experimentally clean energy-gain EELS region
to characterise collective excitations in the topologically insulating material Bi\ :sub:`2`\ Te\ :sub:`3` \ and
correlate them with the underlying crystalline structure with nanoscale resolution. We identify with high
significance the presence of a distinct energy-gain peak around -0.8 eV, with spatially-resolved maps revealing
that its intensity is markedly enhanced at the edge regions of the specimen. findings illustrate the reach of
energy-gain EELS analyses to accurately map collective excitations in quantum materials, a key asset in the quest
towards new tunable plasmonic devices.

    to the latter we display both the median over replicas and the 68% CL intervals. (c,d) Same as Fig. 3c now
