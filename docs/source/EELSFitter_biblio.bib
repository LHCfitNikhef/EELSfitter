         abstract = {Exploiting the information provided by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) requires reliable access to the low-loss region where the zero-loss peak (ZLP) often overwhelms the contributions associated to inelastic scatterings off the specimen. Here we deploy machine learning techniques developed in particle physics to realise a model-independent, multidimensional determination of the ZLP with a faithful uncertainty estimate. This novel method is then applied to subtract the ZLP for EEL spectra acquired in flower-like WS2 nanostructures characterised by a 2H/3R mixed polytypism. From the resulting subtracted spectra we determine the nature and value of the bandgap of polytypic WS2, finding EBG=1.6−0.2+0.3eV with a clear preference for an indirect bandgap. Further, we demonstrate how this method enables us to robustly identify excitonic transitions down to very small energy losses. Our approach has been implemented and made available in an open source Python package dubbed EELSfitter.}

While nanostructures built upon transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with either the 2H or 3R crystalline phases have been routinely studied, knowledge of TMD nanomaterials based on mixed 2H/3R polytypes is far more limited. In this work, mixed 2H/3R free-standing WS2 nanostructures displaying a flower-like configuration are fingerprinted by means of state-of-the-art transmission electron microscopy. Their rich variety of shape-morphology configurations is correlated with relevant local electronic properties such as edge, surface, and bulk plasmons. Machine learning is deployed to establish that the 2H/3R polytype displays an indirect band gap of EBG=1.6−0.2+0.3eV. Further, high resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals energy-gain peaks exhibiting a gain-to-loss ratio greater than unity, a property that can be exploited for cooling strategies of atomically-thin TMD nanostructures and devices built upon them. The findings of this work represent a stepping stone towards an improved understanding of TMD nanomaterials based on mixed crystalline phases.},

Here we present a novel strategy for the determination of the band gap and complex dielectric function in 2D materials achieving a spatial resolution down to a few nanometers. This approach is based on machine learning techniques developed in particle physics and makes possible the automated processing and interpretation of spectral images from electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Individual spectra are classified as a function of the thickness with K-means clustering, and then used to train a deep-learning model of the zero-loss peak background. As a proof of concept we assess the band gap and dielectric function of InSe flakes and polytypic WS2 nanoflowers and correlate these electrical properties with the local thickness. Our flexible approach is generalizable to other nanostructured materials and to higher-dimensional spectroscopies and is made available as a new release of the open-source EELSfitter framework. }

Excitonic peaks at around 2 and 3 eV appear localized at the ends or along the sides of the 1D-MoS2 nanostructures, while the plasmonic resonance at 8.3 eV retains its inner-region localization. It demonstrates the spatial dependence of the bandgap energy, with the central region exhibiting a bandgap of approximately 1.2 eV, consistent with bulk MoS2, while regions characterized by curvature-induced local strain fields exhibit instead a noticeable reduction. The findings provide valuable insights into the intricate relationship between excitonic behavior and bandgap sensitivity in 1D-MoS2 nanostructures, streamlining the design and optimization of nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices.}

The required understanding of the intricate relationship between nanoscale crystal structure and the properties of the resulting plasmonic resonances remains, however, elusive for these materials. Specifically, edge- and surface-induced plasmonic resonances, and other collective excitations, are often buried beneath the continuum of electronic transitions, making it difficult to isolate and interpret these signals using techniques such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Here we focus on the experimentally clean energy-gain EELS region to characterise collective excitations in the topologically insulating material Bi2Te3 and correlate them with the underlying crystalline structure with nanoscale resolution. We identify with high significance the presence of a distinct energy-gain peak around −0.8eV, with spatially-resolved maps revealing that its intensity is markedly enhanced at the edge regions of the specimen. Our findings illustrate the reach of energy-gain EELS analyses to accurately map collective excitations in quantum materials, a key asset in the quest towards new tunable plasmonic devices.}

Theoretical improvements in the PDF description include a systematic implementation of positivity constraints and integrability of sum rules. We validate our methodology by means of closure tests and “future tests” (i.e. tests of backward and forward data compatibility), and assess its stability, specifically upon changes of PDF parametrization basis. We study the internal compatibility of our dataset, and investigate the dependence of results both upon the choice of input dataset and of fitting methodology.

If the velocity of a charged particle in a medium exceeds the velocity of light, photons are emitted leading to a corresponding energy loss of a few electronvolt. Since these losses are strong for energies below the onset of interband transitions, they change the apparent loss function of semiconductors and insulators, with the risk of erroneous interpretation of spectra. We measured low energy losses of Si and GaAs with a monochromated TEM demonstrating the effect of sample thickness on Čerenkov losses. Angle resolved EELS and energy filtered diffraction patterns (taken without a monochromator) show the extremely narrow angular distribution of Čerenkov losses. The latter experiment provides a method that allows to decide whether Čerenkov radiation masks the very low loss signal in EELS.}

         abstract = {The inelastic scattering of fast electrons transmitting thin foils of silicon (Si), silicon nitride (Si3N4), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and cadmium selenide (CdSe) was analyzed using dielectric theory. In particular, the impact of surface and bulk retardation losses on valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy (VEELS) was studied as a function of the foil thickness. It is shown that for the materials analyzed, surface and retardation losses can cause a systematic, thickness-dependent modulation of the dielectric volume losses, which can hamper the determination of the bulk dielectric data as well as the identification of band-gap and interband transition energies by VEELS. For Si and GaAs, where the dielectric function is strongly peaked with high absolute values, retardation losses lead to additional intensity maxima in the spectrum. For thin films of these materials (below ∼100nm), the additional intensity maxima are related to retardation effects due to the finite size of the sample leading to the excitation of guided light modes. For thicker films, exceeding about 200nm, the intensity maxima are caused by bulk retardation losses, i.e., Cerenkov losses. Although thickness-dependent modulations were observed for Si3N4, GaN and CdSe, the form of the dielectric functions and their lower maxima, means that for TEM samples <100nm thick, the band-gap energies of these materials can be accurately identified by VEELS. Guidelines are given that allow for forecasting the impact of surface and retardation losses on VEELS.}

The influence of Cerenkov radiation was significant in measurements using a 200kV transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the correct dielectric function could not be obtained using the conventional EELS procedure. However, a good agreement between the optical data and EELS for the dielectric functions was obtained via a 60kV TEM. Combining EELS and the difference method, however, provided an accurate measurement of the dielectric function for α-Al2O3 even at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. The combination of EELS and the difference method in the nano-beam diffraction mode could derive an accurate dielectric function with superior spatial resolution regardless of the occurrence of Cerenkov radiation.}

For this purpose we use amorphous SiNx:H having a bandgap of EgSiNx:H= 5.5eV. We demonstrate that for bangap determination not only the accurate removal of the ZLP is crucial, moreover also retardation losses have to be taken into account. The same is valid for an accurate determination of the optical properties of semiconductors which can be done if the retardation effects are treated correctly or avoided at all before Kramers–Kronig analysis is applied. Beside the detailed study on using SiNx:H we discuss the impact of the retardation effects on several other semiconductors and insulators, like GaP.}
